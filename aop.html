<br><br>This research has been reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Information to help you understand research is on-line at http://www.research.ucdavis.edu/policiescompliance/irb-admin/.You may talk to a IRB staff member at (916) 703-9151, hs-irbadmin@ucdavis.edu, or 2921 Stockton Blvd, Suite 1400, Room 1429, Sacramento, CA 95817 for any of the following:

<li>You want to talk to someone besides the research team.</li>
<li>You have questions about your rights as a research subject.</li>
<li>	You want to get information or provide input about this research.</li></ul>

<br><b>Why is this research being done?</b>
<br>The purpose of this study is to learn more about what information humans pay attention to in busy sensory environments. In particular, we are interested in learning about how individuals deal with task-relevant and task-irrelevant information when there are many different sources of information available in a visual scene. 

<br><br><b>How long will the research last?</b>
<br>The total time commitment depends on which of the following test you participate in, but in general will vary from 1-4 hours; the maximum duration of your participation will be described to you by the investigator. Some studies may require repeated sessions on different days: If so, this will be made clear to you in advance.

<br><br><b>How many people will be studied?</b>
<br>This study is part of a multi-year project. We expect about 1000 people here will be in this research per year.

<br><br><b>What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?</b>
<br>If you decide to participate in this study, the following will be involved: 
<ol><li>You will be asked to sit in front of a computer screen and pay attention to sounds or pictures shown to you on a computer screen. </li>
<li>You will be asked to make decisions about what you see or hear and to make responses to the stimuli by pressing a button on a gamepad or computer keyboard. The timing and accuracy of your button-press responses will be analyzed to learn about brain and mental processes, but your brain activity will not be directly recorded. </li> 
<li>The position of your eye gaze (i.e., where you are looking on the computer screen) may  be monitored by a remote eye-tracker. </li>
<li>	You may also be asked to fill out a short questionnaire(s) (taking approximately 10 minutes to complete). This questionnaire will ask you to indicate the degree to which you agree with statements about your daily life. You are free to skip all or any portion of the questionnaire without penalty of any kind.</li></ol>
If you give permission, you may be contacted to participate in future research. Your participation in the current experiment is not contingent on your willingness to participate in the future. 

<br><br><b>What happens if I do not want to be in this research?</b>
<br>You may decide not to take part in the research and it will not be held against you.
If you are participating for course credit and elect not to participate in this study, you have the right to sign up for a different study. If you do not wish to participate in research as a volunteer, your course instructor or the participant system (e.g., SONA) coordinator will provide other opportunities for you in place of participation.

<br><br> <b> What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?</b>
<br>You can leave the research at any time and it will not be held against you.

<br><br><b>Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</b>
</br>There is minimal risk to participating in this study.

<br><br><b>Will being in this study help me in any way?</b>
<br>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part in this research. However, the information we get from this study may help us to understand how the human brain and cognitive system functions. This holds many potential benefits for society.

<br><br><b>What happens to the information collected for the research?</b>
<br>The Principal Investigator has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the Federal government that will help protect the privacy of the research records.  The Certificate of Confidentiality allows the Researchers to refuse to disclose identifying information on your participation in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level.  A Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself and your involvement in this research. If you have given your consent for an insurer or employer to obtain information about you, the Researcher may not use the Certificate of Confidentiality to withhold this information. A Certificate of Confidentiality also does not prevent a Researcher from disclosing information about you to prevent serious harm to yourself or others, such as reporting to the authorities' incidents of child abuse, elder abuse or spousal abuse.

<br><br><b>What else do I need to know?</b>
<br>It is important that you promptly tell the person in charge of the research if you believe that you have been injured because of taking part in this study. If you are injured as a result of being in this study, the University of California will provide necessary medical treatment. Depending on the circumstances, the costs of the treatment may be covered by University or the study sponsor or may be billed to your insurance company just like other medical costs. The University and the study sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury.  For more information about compensation, you may call the IRB Administration at (916) 703-9151 or email at HS-IRBAdmin@ucdavis.edu.

<br><br>If you agree to take part in this research study for course credit, you will be given credit on the appropriate platform (e.g., SONA, or by email to your instructor). Otherwise, we will compensate you at a rate of $10/hour for behavioral studies and $20/hour for brain imaging studies. You may be asked for your social security number for payment purposes. It will not be used for any other purpose without your permission.
